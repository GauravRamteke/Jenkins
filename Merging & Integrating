Jenking is a Continous Integration tool.
Whenever is is code change in a centralized repository, or for every commit that is done by the devloper in the source code we have to make a new build for the app.
So to automate the process in this build phase (Fetch/build/test/notify) we use jenkins to automate all these steps whith creating jobs with CI/CD methodology.
We can set notifications in jenkins by that it will allow devlopers if there is any error in the code during this build phase.
